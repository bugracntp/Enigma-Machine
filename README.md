# WHAT IS ENIGMA MACHINE ? 

An Enigma machine is a famous encryption machine used by the Germans during WWII to transmit coded messages. An Enigma machine allows for billions and billions of ways to encode a message, making it incredibly difficult for other nations to crack German codes during the war â€” for a time the code seemed unbreakable. Alan Turing and other researchers exploited a few weaknesses in the implementation of the Enigma code and gained access to German codebooks, and this allowed them to design a machine called a Bombe machine, which helped to crack the most challenging versions of Enigma. Some historians believe that the cracking of Enigma was the single most important victory by the Allied powers during WWII. Using information that they decoded from the Germans, the Allies were able to prevent many attacks. However, to avoid Nazi suspicion that they had insight to German communications, the Allies had to allow some attacks to be carried out despite the fact that they had the knowledge to stop them.

# HOW AN ENIGMA MACHINE WORKS

  An Enigma machine is made up of several parts including a keyboard, a lamp board,rotors, and internal electronic circuitry.Some machines, such as the ones used by the military,have additional features such as a plugboard.Encoded messages would be a particular scramble of letters on a given day that would would translate to a comprehendible sentence when unscrambled.When a key on the keyboard is pressed, one or more rotors move to form a new rotor configuration which will encode one letter as another.Current flows through the machine and lights up one display lamp on the lamp board,which shows the output letter. So if the "K" key is pressed, and the Enigma machine encodes that letter as a "P," the "P" would light up on the lamp board.Each month, Enigma operators received codebooks which specified which settings the machine would use each day. Every morning the code would change.
